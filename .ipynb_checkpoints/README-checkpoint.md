# Monte Carlo Simulations
This is a numerical algorithm to solve mathematical problems by random sampling.

We use this algorithm in 2 different applications:

- Estimating mathematical constants ($\pi, e, \gamma, \sqrt2, \phi, \delta_s$)\
The simulations can be found in [MonteCarloSimulation_EstimatingConstants.ipynb](MonteCarloSimulation_EstimatingConstants.ipynb)

- Estimating stock market prices in the future\
The simulations can be found in [MonteCarloSimulation_Stocks.ipynb](MonteCarloSimulation_Stocks.ipynb)

## Installation
Install by cloning the repository with

    git clone https://github.com/GautamGopalKrishnan/montecarlo.git

## Estimating Constants
The following mathematical constants were estimated using Monte Carlo simulations.

- $\pi$
- $e$ (Euler's number)
- $\gamma$ (Euler's constant)
- $\sqrt2$
- $\phi$ (Golden Ratio)
- $\delta_s$ (Silver Ratio)

## Stock Indices
We estimate the prices in the future of the following stock indices using Monte Carlo simulations.

- NIFTY 50
- NIFTY 100
- NIFTY 200
- NIFTY 500
- NIFTY Next 50
- BSE 500
